Final Project

10.1: Design the interactive system
Choose a task
Design an interactive system for one of the following tasks:
• sketching / notetaking
• previewing and organizing documents or photos
• proxemic interaction¹
• generating music
• modeling / manipulating 3D objects
• any other interesting task, as long as you discuss it with me beforehand

Choose sensible features
The system needs to fulfil the following requirements:
• the Wiimote is used for tracking something (itself, users, pens) in some way
• the sensor data is preprocessed using adequate filters
• you need to design/implement at least one basic interaction technique for each team member, such as:
– pattern/gesture recognition
– copy & paste
– undo
– (chording) text entry
– spatial manipulation of objects (move, rotate, zoom)
– proximity-dependent information display
– any other interaction technique, as long as you discuss it with me beforehand
• the system should be cool
Submission
Hand in the following file:
system_documentation.pdf: a short report (less than 10 pages) describing the system, its usage, and its implementation. A
skilled reader should be able to re-implement the system based on your documentation. If the team has more than one member,
please also document what parts each team member contributed. Please use the official thesis template.
Points
• 4 The paper describes the system well.
• 2 The paper is visually appealing
• 2 The paper has enough detail to allow replication
• 2 The paper is well written.
10.2: Implement the interactive system
Task and submission
Develop a Python application that implements the aforementioned features. The application should be robust and fast.
Hand in the following file:
system_demo.py: a Python script that starts the demo when executed. It should accept a Bluetooth address as command line
parameter for specifying the Wiimote to use. Additional files (e.g., media files) may be handed in, too.
Points
• 6 The application correctly implements all features.
• 3 The application is well documented.
• 3 The application is well-structured and follows the Python style guide (PEP 8).
• 2 The application works robustly
• 2 The application is responsive/fast
• 4 The application is enjoyable and beautiful

10.3: Present the interactive system
Task and submission
Create a short video (~3 minutes) about your system, with a focus on UI, features, and use cases until 30.07.2021 (see separate
submission field in GRIPS).
Hand in the following file (on 30.07.2021):
system_presentation.mp4: a short video that shows all features of your system
Points
• 5 You are able to answer technical questions (separate meeting).
• 5 The video demonstrates the interaction in a real-life use case.
• 3 The video shows all features of the system
• 3 The video is beautiful
Brainstorm your topics
• think about ideas for the final project (alone; 5 minutes)
• place your ideas as posits on the linked Mural and maybe add further ideas (5 minutes)
• brainstorm in small groups to specify a topic which fulfills the requirements above
• find a project group
• discuss the topics with us
